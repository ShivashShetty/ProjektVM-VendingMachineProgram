# Vending Machine Mini-Project README

This README provides information about a vending machine simulation program developed by Team ProjektVM as part of their Computer Science and Engineering mini-project.

# Program Overview

The Vending Machine program is designed to simulate a simple vending machine interface where users can browse available items, add them to their cart, remove items from the cart, and proceed to checkout.

# Features

1. Display Menu: The program displays a menu of available items along with their prices and stock quantities.
2. Add to Cart: Users can select items from the menu and add them to their cart. The program checks stock availability and updates the cart accordingly.
3. Checkout: Users can proceed to checkout, review their cart, and make payments. The program calculates the total amount and provides change if applicable.
4. Remove from Cart: Users can remove items from their cart. The program ensures valid item and quantity selections.

# Usage

1. Compilation: Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc) by running gcc vending_machine.c -o vending_machine.
2. Running: Execute the compiled program with ./vending_machine.
3. Menu: Use the menu options to add items to the cart, proceed to checkout, remove items, or exit the program.
4. Checkout: During checkout, enter the amount to pay. If the payment is successful, change will be provided if applicable.
5. Removal: When removing items, select the item by its number and enter the quantity to remove.
   
# Color Codes
The program uses ANSI escape codes for colorful terminal output. Here are the color codes used:

Red: Error messages and notifications.
Green: Success messages and payment related information.
Yellow: Prompts for user actions.
Blue: Item names and headers.
Cyan: Stock quantities.

# Contributors
